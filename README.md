This assignment aims to ensure that students understand the high-dimensional data types and format. The high-dimensional data visualisations are required using different interaction and illustration tools. This assignment mimics an analyst’s role in real life. The assignment also ensures that students understand the various visualisation techniques when dealing with other forms of high-dimensional data.

Students must analyse and visualise the Tennis dataset containing Australia Open championship matches, which includes 118 years of championship matches, both men and women, between 1905 and 2023. The dataset has various data types and forms, including year, gender, champion’s name, nationality, champion seed, match time, runner-up’s name, nationality, and score. Students have to use the required method to analyse and visualise, which needs to be converted into a different format for comparison.
